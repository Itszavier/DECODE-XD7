## üõ†Ô∏è Introduction
In the world of coding, breaking down complex problems can be challenging. **DECODE-XD7** provides a structured approach to tackle these challenges systematically.


## üîç Steps

1. **D**efine the Problem  
   Clearly outline the problem's requirements and constraints.

2. **E**xplore Examples  
   Create test cases, including edge cases, to understand expected outputs.

3. **C**onceptualize a Solution  
   Develop an outline or pseudocode to visualize the solution.

4. **O**rganize the Plan  
   Arrange the steps logically for implementation.

5. **D**evelop and Code  
   Implement the solution incrementally while testing each part.

6. **E**valuate and Refine  
   Test against examples and optimize the solution for efficiency.
